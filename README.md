# Project Overview  
This Golang backend project is designed as a modular system, emphasizing clean architecture and scalability. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing resources, showcasing best practices in modern backend development.

## Architectural Highlights  
1. **RESTful API:** The application implements endpoints for creating, retrieving, and listing resources, designed with simplicity and adherence to HTTP standards.  
2. **Database Integration:** PostgreSQL is utilized to store and manage data. SQL queries or an ORM like GORM ensures smooth database interactions.  
3. **Middleware:** Authentication, error handling, and request validation middleware enhance security and maintainability.  

## Features  
- Modular file organization, promoting separation of concerns.  
- Structured logging with libraries such as `logrus` or `zap` for detailed insights into API usage and errors.  
- Test-driven development with unit and integration tests.  

## Benefits  
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle increasing loads with ease.  
- **Maintainability:** Modular architecture allows easy updates and feature additions.  
- **Performance:** Optimized code and caching strategies ensure efficient operations.
